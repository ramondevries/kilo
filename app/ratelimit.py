"""Limits on the emailed codes (sign-in and account removal).

Anyone can type any address into the sign-in form, which makes us send a mail to it. Without
limits that is a way to mail-bomb a third party, to ruin the reputation of the mail server
(it carries other mail too), and to try many codes. So before a code is emailed,
`reserve_code()` checks four limits and counts the send against all of them:

* per address: one code per RATELIMIT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS (a double click, a prankster), and at most
  RATELIMIT_ADDRESS_PER_HOUR sign-in codes an hour. Removal codes have their own wait and their
  own RATELIMIT_REMOVAL_PER_HOUR, so signing in and then removing an account do not get in each
  other's way;
* per visitor address: RATELIMIT_IP_PER_HOUR an hour, from the client address in
  `app.security.client_ip()` (a keyed hash of it, a /64 for IPv6). Skipped when the address is
  unknown, never applied to "127.0.0.1" for everybody;
* for the whole site: RATELIMIT_GLOBAL_PER_HOUR an hour, a circuit breaker for the mail reputation.

The limits are on SENDING. A code that was already mailed stays valid and can be entered, so
nobody is locked out of their own address by someone else asking for codes: every send is also
mailed to the owner and the newest code is the valid one. Requests that are refused are not
counted, so they do not extend the wait. A visitor sees the same answer whether or not an
address has an account.

RATELIMIT_MODE: `off` (no checks), `log` (count and log what WOULD be refused, refuse nothing: the
default, for choosing numbers from real traffic) or `enforce`. A limit of 0 turns that limit off.
If the limiter itself fails (a locked database) the request is let through and the failure logged.

The counts live in the `rate_event` table, so they are shared by all gunicorn workers and survive
restarts. Counting and checking is one INSERT ... SELECT per limit, so two workers cannot both slip
under a limit.
