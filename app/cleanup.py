"""Housekeeping for the user table, run daily by scripts/cleanup_signups.py.

Anyone can create an account row by typing an address into the sign-in form, and
nothing else ever removes it. This removes

* **stale sign-ups**: accounts that were never verified and have been idle for
  STALE_SIGNUP_DAYS. Idle is measured from the LATER of the creation time and the
  moment the latest sign-in code was issued, so someone who signed up weeks ago and
  asked for a new code today keeps the row while typing it. A verified account is
  never touched, however long ago its owner signed in, and neither is one that has
  weight entries;
* **expired code hashes**: a sign-in or account-removal code that is past its expiry
  is useless but its hash would otherwise stay in the row until the next code;
* **old rate-limit events**: the counts behind the limits on emailed codes (app/ratelimit.py)
  are only needed for an hour; anything older than a day is deleted;
* **cached avatars** (app/avatar.py) of accounts that no longer exist, and any that has not
  been refreshed for a month.

Each part is a single SQL statement with all its conditions in it, so there is no moment
between "looks stale" and "deleted" in which a code could be verified. Running it twice,
or at any time of day, is safe.
